Together with fellow researchers at [Mila (the Québec AI Institute)](https://groups.google.com/g/music_reading_group){:target="_blank"} and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/){:target="_blank"}, we have the pleasure of inviting you to join the **Music + AI Reading Group**. Our reading group gathers **every Friday at 2pm Eastern Time**. 

Our topics of interest cover (beware : the list is not exhaustive !) :
* 🎹 Music Generation
* 🧠 Music Understanding
* 📇 Music Recommendation
* 🗣 Source Separation and Instrument Recognition
* 🎛 Acoustics
* 🗿 Digital Humanities ...
* 🙌 ... and more (we are waiting for you :]) !

Our purpose is to build an interdisciplinary forum of researchers, students and professors alike, across industry and academia, working at the **intersection of Music and Machine Learning**. During each meeting, **a speaker presents a research paper of their choice during 45’, leaving 15 minutes for questions and discussion**. The purpose of the reading group is to :
* Gather a **group of Music+AI/HCI/others people** to share their research, build collaborations, and meet peer students. We are not constrained to any specific research directions, and all people are welcome to contribute.
* People **share research ideas** and **brainstorm** with others.
* Researchers not actively working on music-related topics but interested in the field can join and keep up with the latest research in the area, sharing their thoughts and bringing in their own backgrounds.
